# Beginners-Intro

This content is used to provide you with fundamental todo's that will help you understand how ruby works.


# Tasks

## Basics, Input/Output, Primitive Operations, and 

### 001 hello world

**Task:** Create a file that outputs "Helloooo, it's me" when being executed.


### 002 hello darling

**Task:** Create a file that takes a value and prints out  "Hello {name}, you will be my darling from now!" when being executed.

**Hint:** You need to find out how to take and work with user-input, as well as using variables to save your input.


### 003 adding two numbers

**Task:** Add two numbers that are being typed in when starting the program. Before typing the first number: Display some user instructions: "Type in the first number:" and after typing the first "Type in the second number:". After the user input is finished, the program should display "The result is {result}"

**Hint:** Find out what type conversion is and how you need to adopt it.

**Goal:** Learn how to use primitive operations.

### 004 simple calculator

**Task:** Take 2 input values and add them together. 

Advanced

**Hint:** 

**Goal:** Learn how to use primitive operations

### 005 Wordmixer

**Goal:** Learn how to work with strings.
**Task:** Take an input String and perform multiple operations on that input. All operations should be performed one after another and outputed to the standard output/console.

- (1) Double the input
- (2) Reverse the input
- (3) Downcase the input
- (4) Capitalize the input
- (5) Uppercase the input
- (6) Reverse and uppercase the input

More advanced:
- (7) Return the first letter
- (8) Return each letter capitalized
- (9) A random letter from the word


**Hint:** Use the

## 006 Word repeater

**Task:** Write a program that takes a number and a String as input and repeat that String as many times as given. Define a function for executing the logic so that you can reuse the code.

**Goal:** Learn how to use function arguments and define your first loop.


**Hint:**



### 009 Your Calculator

**Goal:** Structure your accomplished knowledge and structure it so that you can enable your user to 

**Task:** Create a calculator using the interactive ruby console. Further extensions include:
- [] after calculating an event reset your result or copy it to the clipboard

**Hint:** 


# Introduction to Object orientation 

### 010 Create your first class

**Goal:** Here you can start out with your first self-defined class. A class is an essential part of ruby which gives you the power to introduce object-oriented programming into your code. Without classes, you would miss an object that allows you to define attributes as you need to represent real-world objects.

**Task:** Think about your favorite event and start defining all potential attributes you would like to store about this particular event.

**Hint:**


## 011 Matchbox vehicles collector

**Task:** Imagine yourself collecting a new kind of matchbox generation. Now there are not just cars in the matchbox ecosystem, but also electric bikes, quads, motorbikes, tanks and all other kinds of vehicles you can think of. Your task is to find a suitable overarching class that will collect as many generalized attributes as possible. But be careful, just select that attributes that are really relevant to all others!

**Hint:**

**Goal:**


## 040 products data analyzer 

**Task:** In this task you should analyze a file that contains a large table of product data. In this case there are multiple race bikes listed. And we want to find out some question about that data.

(1) Which columns do exist in this dataset?


(2) What is the most expensive bike?
() What is the most popular bike color?
